    title: 'Immutable Storage of Process Logs on a Private Blockchain',
    description: `As part of my master's thesis, I developed a mechanism designed to 
      enable the storage of logs stemming from the execution of process in a BPMS
      in an immutable manner on a private blockchain. I achieved this using the 
      Hyperledger Fabric test net and a smart contract to store the log data in JSON format
      as transactions on the blockchain. In collaboration with the University Chair, this thesis
      was published in and presented at the 2024 Business Process Management Forum, in Krakow, Poland.`,
